# The 2024 Monte Carlo Reaction Rates Evaluation 

This repository contains the reaction rates information for the 2024 Monte
Carlo reaction rates evaluation by C. Iliadis *et al.* (see [paper](xxxx)). 

Each evaluated reaction is assigned a directory containing the input file for
the [RatesMC](https://github.com/rlongland/RatesMC) code, as well as one of the
outputs from this code. The output displays the reaction rate vs. temperature
in a machine readable format.
